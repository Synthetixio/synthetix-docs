# State

## Description

An external state contract whose functions can only be called by an [associated controller](#associatedcontract) if modified with [`onlyAssociatedContract`](#onlyassociatedcontract).

This is designed to allow behaviour to be decoupled from storage so that upgrades can be made without losing data.

The address (presumably a contract) which is permitted to use functions on this contract which have the [`onlyAssociatedContract`](#onlyassociatedcontract) modifier.

**Type:** `address`

## Constructor

### `constructor`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.27.4/contracts/State.sol#L13)</sub>

Initialises the associated contract and the owner, who has the exclusive right to switch the associated contract.

??? example "Details"

    **Signature**

    `(address _associatedContract)`

    **Visibility**

    `internal`

    **State Mutability**

    `nonpayable`

    **Requires**

    * [require(..., Owner must be set)](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.27.4/contracts/State.sol#L15)

    **Emits**

    * [AssociatedContractUpdated](#associatedcontractupdated)

## Restricted Functions

### `setAssociatedContract`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.27.4/contracts/State.sol#L24)</sub>

Allows the contract's owner to update the [associated contract](#associatedContract).

??? example "Details"

    **Signature**

    `setAssociatedContract(address _associatedContract)`

    **Visibility**

    `external`

    **State Mutability**

    `nonpayable`

    **Modifiers**

    * [onlyOwner](#onlyowner)

    **Emits**

    * [AssociatedContractUpdated](#associatedcontractupdated)

## Modifiers

### `onlyAssociatedContract`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.27.4/contracts/State.sol#L31)</sub>

Reverts the transaction if the `msg.sender` is not the [associated contract](#associatedcontract). Provided for use by inheriting contracts.

## Events

### `AssociatedContractUpdated`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.27.4/contracts/State.sol#L38)</sub>

The associated contract was updated by the owner. This event reports the new associated contract.

**Signature**: `AssociatedContractUpdated(address associatedContract)`
