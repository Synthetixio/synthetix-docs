# BinaryOption

## Description

The BinaryOption contract provides ERC20 token functionality for the
options in a [BinaryOptionMarket](BinaryOptionMarket.md). One `BinaryOption`
instance is created for each of the long and short sides of the market.
Once claimed, binary options can be transferred around like
any other ERC20 token until they are exercised from their parent market.

This contract tracks the value on a particular side of the market throughout
the entire lifecycle, handling both bid and option balances, and the basic operations of
converting between them. Whenever a bid is made or refunded, or an option
claimed or exercised, the values in this contract are updated by the market.

On invocation, the bid is set to zero, while [`claimableBalanceOf(account)`](#claimablebalanceof) tokens are issued into the account.
The `Issued` event emitted is accompanied by a `Transfer` event from the zero address.

## Internal Functions

### `_claimableBalanceOf`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.27.4/contracts/BinaryOption.sol#L50)</sub>

See [`claimableBalanceOf`](#claimablebalanceof).

This function requires the quantity of [exercisable deposits](BinaryOptionMarket.md#exercisabledeposits) in the parent
market just in case the claimable value in the last account is different from the remaining deposits
by a few wei due to rounding errors.

??? example "Details"

    **Signature**

    `_claimableBalanceOf(uint256 _bid, uint256 price, uint256 exercisableDeposits) returns (uint256)`

    **Visibility**

    `internal`

    **State Mutability**

    `view`

    **Requires**

    * [require(..., supply < claimable)](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.27.4/contracts/BinaryOption.sol#L74)

### `_requireMinimumBid`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.27.4/contracts/BinaryOption.sol#L100)</sub>

Reverts the transaction if the bid provided to its argument is less than 1 cent. This minimum value ensures that
any last-bidder attacks based on the rounding error must accumulate at least $10^{16}$ wei worth of rounding
errors before they spill over into other accounts. A single division during the [`claim`](#claim)
function is the only thing that introduces such rounding errors, so such rounding-based attacks would require
an infeasibly-large number of accounts to perform.

    `_requireMinimumBid(uint256 bid) returns (uint256)`
