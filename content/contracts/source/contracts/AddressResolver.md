# AddressResolver

## Description

This contract is a type of Service Locator pattern that allows for easier interaction between multiple contracts. Instead of contract A needing references to contracts B and C (and updating ever release), contract A can refer to an `AddressResolver` and query for B and C at transaction time. Then, during a release, the AddressResolver is updated with the latest B and C contarct. Thus this ensures that contract A always has the latest B and C contracts.

!!! Warning "Not yet on mainnet"

    This view, while in source, is not yet on mainnet. It is planned in the `v2.23` Acrux release. As a workaround you can use `IAddressResolver.getAddress("Synthetix").synths(key)`

??? example "Details"

    **Signature**

    `getSynth(bytes32 key) returns (address)`

    **Visibility**

    `external`

    **State Mutability**

    `view`

Import one or more addresses into the system for the given keys. Note: this function will overrwite any previous entries with the same key names, allowing for inline updates.

??? example "Details"

    **Signature**

    `importAddresses(bytes32[] names, address[] destinations)`
