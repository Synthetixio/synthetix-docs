# BinaryOptionMarket

## Description

This contract manages a single binary option market, where users can speculate on the outcome of a future event
by buying options, each of which is an ERC20 token that pays out 1 sUSD if its corresponding outcome occurs.

Each binary option market has a specific underlying asset, and a strike price for that asset at a particular
maturity date. If the reported price of the asset is lower than the strike price at the maturity date, then
all the options on the short side of the market pay out 1 sUSD each, while if the price is higher than or equal
to the strike price, then the options on the long side pay out 1 sUSD each.

This contract was proposed as part of [SIP-53](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-53). Further information on the
mechanism and its motivation can be found in the SIP.

**Market Lifecycle**

A market goes through four major phases in its life. The phase a market is currently in
can be queried with the [`phase()`](#phase) function, and the time stamps at which it transitions
between these phases is held in the [`times`](#times) public variable.

**Market Creation**

A market can be created by anyone, as long as they can provide enough initial capital to [ensure
the market is liquid](#creatorlimits). Upon creation, markets will be
[tracked in the manager contract](BinaryOptionMarketManager.md#activemarkets)
until they are eventually resolved and destroyed.

Market creators are incentivised to make markets by the collection of [fees](#fees),
which they share with the fee pool. These fees are released at the resolution of the market;
it is in the creator's interest, in order to maximise the fees they collect, to set
market parameters that attract the maximum demand over the lifetime of the market.

Binary option markets are created by calls to the [`BinaryOptionMarketManager.createMarket`](BinaryOptionMarketManager.md#createmarket)
function: see the documentation for that function for more details.

**Bidding**

During the bidding phase, the total supply of options and option prices are established.
During this period, users can bid on the long or short side of the market and refund those bids.
The option prices are determined during this phase according to the computations outlined in the
[`_updatePrices`](#_updateprices) function; the price on one side of the market is effectively the
fraction of bids on that side relative to all bids.

to the creator fee.

**Type:** `address`

### `creatorLimits`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.45.2/contracts/BinaryOptionMarket.sol#L56)</sub>

The limits that the market creator is constrained to abide by.

- `capitalRequirement`: the minimum capital that the market's [creator](#creator) must maintain in the market until the end of
  bidding. The market's initial bids must be at least this value, and the creator may not submit refunds that
  would reduce their open bids to a value less than this minimum.
- `skewLimit`: The creator's smaller bid must be greater than this as a percentage of their total bids.

**Type:** `struct BinaryOptionMarketManager.CreatorLimits`

### `deposited`

The sum of open bids on both sides of the market, plus any sUSD witheld for refund fees.
We store this explicitly in case any tokens are transferred to this contract directly, as in that
case querying the contract's sUSD token balance would throw off several calculations.

**Type:** `uint256`

### `fees`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.45.2/contracts/BinaryOptionMarket.sol#L55)</sub>

## Constructor

### `constructor`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.45.2/contracts/BinaryOptionMarket.sol#L76)</sub>

The constructor sets up all the static values for [fees](#fees), [timestamps](#times), [asset and strike price](#oracledetails) among other parameters.
The market's owner (the [manager](BinaryOptionMarketManager.md) contract), and [creator](#creator) are also set at this time.
The manager checks that all of these settings are within acceptable ranges, except for the creator limits, which are
[checked here](#_checkcreatorlimits).

In addition, the market's [`BinaryOption`](BinaryOption.md) instances for each side of the market are instantiated,
and their initial prices are computed from the initial bids.

Note that the market's known [`AddressResolver`](AddressResolver.md) address will be incorrect at first,
being initially set to the provided owner address, but this will be remedied after the first sync, which
is performed by the manager contract upon construction.

Initial timestamps should be provided in the order `[biddingEnd, maturity, destruction]`, initial bids as
`[longBid, shortBid]`, and fees as `[poolFee, creatorFee, refundFee]`.

### `bidOrRefundForPrice`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.45.2/contracts/BinaryOptionMarket.sol#L268)</sub>

Produces the size of bid or refund necessary on a particular side of the market to move the price on one side
or the other to a desired level.

For example, to move the long price to $0.8$ by bidding on the long side, one would have to bid
`bidOrRefundForPrice(Side.Long, Side.Long, 0.8 * UNIT, false)`. On the other hand, to move the short price
to $0.6$ by refunding on the long side, one would need to refund `bidOrRefundForPrice(Side.Long, Side.Short, 0.6 * UNIT, true)`.

If the result would be negative, because the desired operation can only move the price in the opposite direction
from the target, the function returns 0.

??? info "Formula Derivation"

    For brevity, the following definitions will be used:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
       \begin{split}
       \psi &:= 1 - (\text{poolFee} + \text{creatorFee}) \\
       \xi  &:= 1 - \text{refundFee} \\
       D    &:= \text{deposited()} \\
       P_{this}, P_{that} &:= \text{prices()} \\
       Q_{this}, Q_{that} &:= \text{totalBids()} \\
       \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    The variables $\text{this}$ and $\text{that}$ refer to the opposite sides of the market. Since prices
    are symmetrical between the sides of the market, they can be interpreted in either order.

    If a bid with value $b$ is placed on $\text{this}$ side of the market, the resulting prices are as follows:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
       \begin{split}
       P_{this} & \leftarrow \frac{Q_{this} + b}{\psi (D + b)} \\
       P_{that} & \leftarrow \frac{Q_{that}}{\psi (D + b)}
       \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    The case of a refund of value $r$ must take the refund fee into account:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
       \begin{split}
       P_{this} &\leftarrow \frac{Q_{this} - r}{\psi (D - \xi r)} \\
       P_{that} &\leftarrow \frac{Q_{that}}{\psi (D - \xi r)}
       \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    So by bidding or refunding on $this$ side of the market, we alter the prices on both sides. Note that bids always
    increase prices on $this$ side and decrease prices on $that$ side, while refunds always decrease prices on $this$
    side and increase prices on $that$ side.

    **Same-Side Price Targeting**

    By changing our position on $this$ side of the market, we can change $P_{this}$ to a desired level $P^{*}_{this}$.
    If $P_{this} < P^{*}_{this}$, we must bid a value $b$ to increase the price, while if $P^{*}_{this} < P_{this}$,
    we must refund a value $r$ to decrease the price, as follows:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
       \begin{split}
       b &\leftarrow \frac{\psi D P_{this} - Q_{this}}{1 - \psi P_{this} } \\
       r &\leftarrow \frac{Q_{this} - \psi D P_{this}}{1 - \xi \psi P_{this}}
       \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    **Opposite-Side Price Targeting**

    Similarly, by changing our position on $this$ side, we can also change $P_{that}$ to a desired level $P^{*}_{that}$.
    The response of the market is the opposite to the same-side case, so if $P_{that} < P^{*}_{that}$, we must refund
    a value $r$ to increase the price, while if $P^{*}_{that} < P_{that}$, we must bid a value $b$ to decrease the
    price, as follows:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
       \begin{split}
       r &\leftarrow \frac{\psi D P_{that} - Q_{that}}{\xi \psi P_{that}} \\
       b &\leftarrow \frac{Q_{that} - \psi D P_{that}}{\psi P_{that}}
       \end{split}
    \end{equation}

    Note that all of these values can be negative if the desired price is in the wrong direction relative to the way
    it will move given the side of the market we're looking at and whether we're bidding or refunding. Since we

The market will also destroy its child [`BinaryOption`](BinaryOption.md#expire) instances before it destroys itself.

The function will revert if the market is not [resolved](#resolved), or if there are options remaining and
the market is not yet past its expiry date. This means that a market can be expired early if all its
in-the-money options have been exercised.

Market resolution requires fetching the latest price of this market's underlying asset, checking
that it was last updated [recently enough](#_isfreshpriceupdatetime), and then computing and saving
the fees that were collected. After a successful invocation, the variable [`resolved`](#resolved)
will be true. The final oracle price is saved and can be queried from
[`oracleDetails.finalPrice`](#oracledetails).

This function reverts the transaction if the system is suspended or the manager contract is paused.

### `_computePrices`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.45.2/contracts/BinaryOptionMarket.sol#L215)</sub>

Computes the market prices from the long and short bid totals, and the funds deposited in the contract.
These prices are computed approximately as follows:

    longPrice  = longBids  / (feeMultiplier * deposited)
    shortPrice = shortBids / (feeMultiplier * deposited)

Interpreting [`/`](/contracts/source/libraries/SafeDecimalMath.md#dividedecimalround) and [`*`](/contracts/source/libraries/SafeDecimalMath.md#multiplydecimalround)
as [fixed point math operators (with rounding)](/contracts/source/libraries/SafeDecimalMath.md).

Note that the denominator `_feeMultiplier * deposited` is the total value of options awarded to each side of the market,
and `deposited` is equal to `longBids + shortBids + refundFeesCollected`.

If either the long or short bids are zero, then the transaction is reverted, as
this would lead to a zero price, and hence divisions-by-zero when computing claimable option
quantities. This means that the initial bids cannot both be zero, nor can the entire balance
on either side of the market be refunded.

## External Functions

### `bid`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.45.2/contracts/BinaryOptionMarket.sol#L426)</sub>

Allows a user to place an sUSD bid on one or the other side of the market.

To process a bid, the market increments the user's [bid balance](#bidsof) on the appropriate option contract,
as well as incrementing the total value deposited both [in this market](#deposited) and in the
[manager contract](BinaryOptionMarketManager.md#totaldeposited). The deposit quantities having been updated,
the option prices are [recomputed](#_updateprices) to reflect the changed odds.

The value of the bid is withdrawn from the message sender's sUSD balance by a call to
`ERC20.transferFrom`, so the caller must have ensured that
they have granted the market sufficient approval and that they have enough
sUSD to support the bid.

The transaction reverts if this function is called outside the bidding period, if the system is suspended,
or if the manager contract is paused.

### `claimOptions`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.45.2/contracts/BinaryOptionMarket.sol#L526)</sub>

Once the bidding period has concluded, this function claims all options [owing](#claimablebalancesof) to the message
sender on both sides of the market. The number of options owed is simply the user's [bid balances](#bidsof), divided
by the [current option prices](#prices). The caller's bid balances are set to zero, while the appropriate number
of options are credited to their wallet.

This function reverts the transaction if the system is suspended or the manager contract is paused.

Implemented by the [`_claimOptions`](#_claimoptions) function.

### `exerciseOptions`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.45.2/contracts/BinaryOptionMarket.sol#L530)</sub>

`exerciseOptions` allows a user to claim any sUSD owed to them after their options have matured.
This function will exercise any options held by the message sender on either side of the market,
zeroing out their option balances. If the caller holds $n$ options on the winning side of the market,
they will be transferred $n$ sUSD. Any options held on the losing side of the market will yield no
payout. Upon exercising options, the quantity of sUSD paid to the called will be deducted from
the tracked totals [here](#deposited), and in the [manager contract](BinaryOptionMarketManager.md#totaldeposited).

If the market is unresolved at call time, it will be resolved if it can be. If the caller
has unclaimed options, they will be claimed before they are exercised.

This function reverts the transaction if the system is suspended or the manager contract is paused.

### `refund`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.45.2/contracts/BinaryOptionMarket.sol#L441)</sub>

Refunds an existing bid, remitting the refund value minus a percentage determined by the [refund fee rate](#fees) as sUSD.
The function returns the value refunded as sUSD.

The full value of the refund is deducted from the caller's bids, while this value minus the refund fee
is actually remitted as sUSD. The deposited quantity in [the market](#deposited)
and in the [manager contract](BinaryOptionMarketManager.md#totaldeposited) are decremented by the transferred
value. The deposit quantities having been updated, the option prices are [recomputed](#_updateprices) to reflect the
changed odds.

The refund fee, which will eventually be paid out to option-holders, is retained in the pot,
although not on either side's bid total. As such, refunds discount option
prices for all those remaining in the market.

If the message sender is the market's [creator](#creator), then a refund transaction will revert
if it would either violate the [capital requirement](#capitalrequirement), or if
it would refund their entire position on either side of the market.

The transaction reverts if this function is called outside the bidding period, if the system is suspended,
or if the manager contract is paused.
