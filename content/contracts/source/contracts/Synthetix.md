??? example "Details"

    - [`Depot`](Depot.md): The depot trades SNX and therefore knows the Synthetix address.
    - [`Exchanger`](Exchanger.md) The helper contract that performs the heavy lifting for `exchange()` and `settle()`.
    - [`ExchangeRates`](ExchangeRates.md): The Synthetix contract fetches prices from the exchange rates contract to facilitate synth exchange and to determine the value of various quantities of synths.
    - [`FeePool`](FeePool.md): The Synthetix contract remits exchange fees as sUSD to the fee pool, and also uses it to keep track of historical issuance records for each issuer.
    - [`Issuer`](Issuer.md) The helper contract that performs the heavy lifting for `issueSynths()`, `issueMaxSynths()` and `burnSynths()`.
    - [`Proxy`](Proxy.md): The Synthetix contract, which is [`Proxyable`](Proxyable.md), exists behind a `CALL`-style proxy for upgradeability.
    - [`RewardEscrow`](RewardEscrow.md): This is similar to the SynthetixEscrow contract, but it is where the SNX inflationary supply is kept before it is released to Synth issuers.
    - [`RewardsDistribution`](RewardsDistribution): This contract works closely with RewardEscrow to release portions of the inflationary supply to different recipients.
    - [`SupplySchedule`](SupplySchedule.md): The supply schedule determines the rate at which SNX are released from the inflationary supply.
    - [`Synth`](Synth.md): Synthetix manages the supply of synths. It keeps track of which ones exist, and they are all issued and burnt from the Synthetix contract. The Synthetix contract is also responsible for exchange between different synth flavours.
    - [`SynthetixEscrow`](SynthetixEscrow.md): The escrow contract keeps track of SNX owed to participants in the initial token sale, and releases them according to specified vesting schedules.
    - [`SynthetixState`](SynthetixState.md): This state contract stores the debt ledger and the current issuance information for synth issuers.

### `mint`

<sub>[Source](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/v2.47.0-ovm/contracts/Synthetix.sol#L114)</sub>

This function is responsible for creating the inflationary SNX supply. It is a public function, so any address can ensure new tokens are released on schedule. When a new quantity is minted, the calling address is rewarded with a small incentive of SNX tokens, defined by [`SupplySchedule.minterReward`](SupplySchedule.md#minterreward).

The supply is released according to the schedule defined in [`SupplySchedule.schedules`](SupplySchedule.md#schedules), being sent to the [`RewardsDistribution`](RewardsDistribution.md#distributerewards) contract for distribution and escrow. The total supply SNX supply is thus increased by the quantity specified by the schedule.

This function always returns true if the transaction did not revert.
